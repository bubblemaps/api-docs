## You need a Partner Id

The iFrame will only work if you specify a `partnerId` value.

You can use the `demo` partner id to test things out on `localhost` or `0.0.0.0`, but if you want to actually deploy the iFrame on your site, we'll need to set up a real partner id for you. This unique id is what unlocks integration on your domains (we'll ask you your production and development domains to whitelist on our side).

  We can also set up a custom color theme to better match your brand, it will be
  triggered by your partner id.

## Basic Usage

No worries, if you just want something simple (for example if you’re a token company and want to display your own map on your showcase website) you won't have to pay a subcription. Some one-time fees may apply depending on custom labelling or marketing needs. [Contact us](mailto:contact@bubblemaps.io?subject=Iframe%20Integration%20Inquiry) and we’ll discuss it.

## Exchanges & Analytics Platforms

We have multiple subscription plans depending on volume, customization options, chains support, marketing support, etc. Please [get in touch](mailto:contact@bubblemaps.io?subject=Iframe%20Integration%20Inquiry) for more details.
