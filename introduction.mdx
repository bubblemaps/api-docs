## Two Separate Products

Before getting heads down in the docs, you should take the time to ascertain which of our two products you want to work with.

- **iFrame Integration**: Ready-to-use Bubblemaps. Our main product, what most of our clients use. A very easy one-liner integration to feature our visuals into your platform, like an autonomous widget. Battle-tested by the industry most famous names (CoinGecko, DexScreener, etc).
- **Data API** _[Beta]_: Get technical. Directly access our data and present it the way you want within your service. Holders, transfers, clusters, exposed through a REST API.

## Which one should you choose?

If you're still unsure what product is the best for you, here's some help:

- You are a crypto platform for monitoring tokens, like a chart app, or a telegram monitoring bot, and you want to quickly add some visual value to your app: **Go with the iFrame**.
- You are a launchpad, and want to provide an easy visual tool to help your users navigate tokens launched though your platform: **Go with the iFrame**.
- You are a token company, and want to demonstrate transparency, validate your tokenomics against your actual supply distribution: **Go with the iFrame** and integrate your own map to your website.
- You are a crypto analytics company, like a DeFi analytics app, or a telegram trading bot, and you want to fetch, process, and integrate our data into your codebase and pipelines: **Go with the API**.
