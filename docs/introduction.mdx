## What is this?

We've been getting a lot of inquiries from our iFrame partners and other tech teams to expose our data in an API.

That's why we're now exploring this option! Keep in mind this is still an early version, that we will build over progressively.

<Warning>
  This API does not come with any guarantees or SLA of any kind yet. Please use
  with caution!
</Warning>

## iFrame Integration

This is not the documentation for the iFrame Integration, only for the API.

<Note>With the API, you can access our data but not our visuals.</Note>

If you're interested in integrating our iFrame widget into your platform, please report to the iFrame documentation.
