title: "Get Supported Chains"
openapi: "GET /chains"

Get the list of chains that we currently support.

Mind the `is_public` attribute: a non-public chain won't be available on the main app yet, and you won't be able to query maps of tokens from this chain either.

A non-public chain will usually get public in a matter of weeks, the non-public state is purely transitory.

<Note>
  Bubblemaps is omni-chain, which means that if you query an ethereum map for
  example, you might get relationships for transfers from other EVM chains. On
  the API level, this includes transfers from chains that are not public yet!
