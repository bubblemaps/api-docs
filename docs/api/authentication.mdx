## Get Your Key

To access this API, you'll need an API key. [Reach out](mailto:api@bubblemaps.io) to ask for one.

<Note>
  This API is still in preview, we give API keys to hand-selected partners.
</Note>

## Rate Limiting

For now, we apply a daily query-seconds limit, negociated on a case by case basis.

This means that when you make a query, we time how long it takes to compute, and store that information. If you go over your allowed query-seconds for the day, you'll start getting `429` errors.

<Check>
  Cache is shared with other API consumers, **including the app and iFrame
  integrations**. Which means that if you query highly demanded maps, you'll
  most likely hit cache, minimizing query-seconds usage.
</Check>

<Info>The daily limit resets at midnight UTC</Info>

## Using Your Key

Pass your key in the `X-ApiKey` header of your requests.

Try this out in the [interactive endpoints documentation](/docs/api/endpoints/get-supported-chains).
