## What is this?

Bubblemaps iFrames are a very easy one-liner integration to integrate our visuals into your platform, like an autonomous widget.

Our iFrames have been battle-tested by the industry most famous names like CoinGecko and DexScreener.

In today's climate of scammy meme-coins, centralized DAOs, celebrities launching rigged tokens with bundled supply, and the ever-growing complexity of blockchain data, you **need** Bubblemaps to navigate the DeFi.

Stand out from your competitors: Provide transparency, safety, and easy, visual value to your users with Bubblemaps iFrames.
