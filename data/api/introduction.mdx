## What is this?

We've been getting a lot of inquiries from our iFrame partners and other tech teams to expose our data in an API.

That's why we're now exploring this option! Keep in mind this is still an early version, that we will build over progressively.

<Note>
  Before reading more, make sure you are interested in the Data API, and not the
  iFrame Integration, which is a different thing entirely. In case of doubt,
  refer back to the differences [here](/introduction).
</Note>

<Warning>
  This API is in beta and does not come with any guarantees or SLA of any kind
  yet. Schemas and endpoints may change without notice. Please use with caution!
